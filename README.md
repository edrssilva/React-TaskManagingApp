# Task Managing App

The deployed version can be accessed by the following link:
https://react-task-managing-app.vercel.app/

I developed this task managing app to begin my studies on React using Vite, this app contains the following functions:

- Adding tasks with title and description
- Listing all added tasks
- Chaging the completed attribute of each task on click
- Showing task details(descrition) on another page
- Deleting tasks

With this app I also began to use TailwindCSS which proves yourself to be a really powerfull, easy to use and fast CSS Framework.

Next projects I'm going to work in:

- Finances Managing App
- Image Galery
- Note Taker
