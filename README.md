# Task Managing App

I developed this task managing app to begin my studies on React using Vite, this app contains the following functions:
  - Adding tasks with title and description
  - Listing all added tasks
  - Chaging the completed attribute of each task on click
  - Showing task details(descrition) on another page
  - Deleting tasks

With this app I also began to use TailwindCSS which proves yourself to be a really powerfull, easy to use and fast CSS Framework.
